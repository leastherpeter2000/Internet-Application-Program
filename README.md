#Assessment 1
The develop an e-commerce Website with at least five pages promoting a product or service of your choice. At a minimum, your website must include the following:
1. Home (index.html) consisting of section/article elements describing some applications or benefit of the product to your audience. These should contain one or more images each.
2. Product pages generally promoting each product. This should have a relevant video. (Note that you are not required to create a video file).
3. A registration page for account creation utilising appropriate form controls. It should not be possible to submit a malformed email address and name fields should only contain letters and spaces. (Note that you are not required to conduct server-side processing of the formâ€™s data in this assignment).
4. Customised presentation that allows the user to customise the basic font size and the background colour of the header elements used across all pages of the website. Their preference should be stored in Local Storage (using the Local Storage API) and used to control presentation the next time that they visit the site.
5. A thumbnail image of each product should animate into a large version when it is clicked. This should be coded in JavaScript using the window.setInterval() and window.clearInterval ()methods or similar methods.
